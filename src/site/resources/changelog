version 0.3.3 (05/06/2015)
- CLI : option -sampling land=... does not work
version 0.3.2 (13/05/2015)
- Optimize A and DIST metric calculation
- MultiScale generation : better handling of land use
version 0.3.1 (27/02/2015)
- Metric result dialog : remove button now works
- Show the distance intervals in metric name
- Add icon and splash screen
version 0.3 (26/02/2015)
WARNING : projects are incompatible with previous versions.
- Multi resolution support (viewshed only)
- Metrics are integrated in the GUI
- Several distance intervals can be used for some metrics (A, S, SL)
- Add metrics : FD (fractal dimension), P (viewshed perimeter), C (viewshed compactness), SD (shannon on distances), SL (skyline length ratio)
- Landuse colors are correclty saved in the project
version 0.2.2
CAUTION : older project must be removed, the dtm envelope was shifted by one pixel
- In tangential mode, the view is always centered on the orientation
- CLI : for points sampling, the bounds are overridable by fields in the shapefile (dmin, dmax, zmin, zmax, orien, amp)
- CLI : bug : manage only one global option
- Metrics : add Rast metric which is not really a metric... save the view in one raster for each point (for debugging purpose)
version 0.2.1 (29/09/2014)
- Metric : add DIST metric
version 0.2 (24/09/2014)
- UI : viewshed is updated for each clic
- CLI : add commands metrics : --viewmetric --tanmetric
- CLI : remove commands --global --globaltan
- CLI : add -sampling option with 3 modes : n for grid sampling, land for land selection and points for external shapefile
- Metrics : SUM SHAN IJI CONTAG
version 0.1
